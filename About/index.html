    <h1>Aviva Nguyen</h1>
    <h5>UX/UI Designer</h5>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Aviva!</p>
    <p>I have a large background in customer service which assists me in interpersonal communication. Through this work experience, I have also learned that customers sometimes don't know exactly what they are asking for or have various approaches. So it was my job to understand their request, re-confirm it, and bring that customer satisfaction into action.</p>
    <p>I majored and got my BS degree in Event Meeting and Management. My journey in events came to a stop due to the pandemic. But it was still an adventure to work in a hotel and work weddings.</p>
    <p>My hobbies consist of watching movies, being cozy with my cat, and drawing. I mainly specialize in anime-style drawing or scenic traditional medium art.</p>
